#   Assignment Notes

##  Issues
1. Asset image sizes are not accurate ratios/sizes in a number of areas.  Namely the dining sets section, it was difficult to match the image sizes with the design.  Would most likely request larger images to then re-cut in photo editor.
2. Heading sizes and weights are different throughout design.  Matched design as much as possible, but would bring this up to design to ensure more linear style guide.
3. Icons are PNG format while I would request SVG icons for page speed as well as pixel perfect sizing and sharpness.
4. Grey testimonial areas are not uniform either... dependent on different designs, would want to make these more uniform.  Would remove the designed circle image and make this dynamic with a square image and hide with CSS.
5. Kept more uniform spacing between sections... design has a few inconsistencies with spacing and centering.
6. Would build out bg-callout section to have type overlapping the image for dynamic purposes.  Began work but realized copy was part of the image.
7. I would inquire about the review arrows at 1280px - have them set up in contained-width, but could move them to the outside of the block but UI implications with this.  Alignment with header title line is currently off.
8. No mobile image for bg-callout section.
9. would cleanup CSS a bit more for a mobile-first approach.  swung back for a quick pass and not as efficient as would like.
